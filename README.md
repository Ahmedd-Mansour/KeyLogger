## KeyLogger
This project was created for educational purposes to learn about C# and Windows API concepts.

# What I Learned

- How to use delegates and callbacks to handle events.

- How Windows hooks allow programs to intercept system events and how callbacks are installed.

- Using P/Invoke to call unmanaged Windows API functions from C#.

- Practicing file writing and console debugging.

- Awareness of system security protections and permissions when working with low-level hooks.
